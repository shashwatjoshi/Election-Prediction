# Election-Prediction


The United States of America has a tough electoral process which is interesting enough to make predictions and analyze. 
The new aspect of this project is dealing with missing values in the dataset which have been taken care into using the “mice package”. 



Smarter Baseline : as for a regular baseline were we look into the two classes and selecting one to make the base line but in this course of action we may miss out the important instances when the decision was neither of the two classes.
Therefore a sign function is used for the construction of a smarter baseline model. The model is constructed by checking the correlations among the variables.
